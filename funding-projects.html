            <p> According to his interview, Adolph does not want his son to continue his steps, but if the son does, he will still support him in whatever he does. Therefore our Center will be designed and developed to offer his and all children with any other possibilities in life progress such as arts, gaming, science, engineering, etc... Anything of their interest and possible options from around the globe. Ownership and profits will be divided between the organizations and his children strategically. Since they are young and they are having a lot of adults around them now, we will lock their 49% ownership and 50% profits into a bank account unlockable only by children after they reach the age of 21. Profits from our side will only go back into the organization for growth and charity projects. The owner and developer doesn't want anything in return. On contrary, he paid and will continue to pay and give all life-long ideas to create environment where they can  reach for the stars. They are the only ones who will be part of the ownership and leadership team when they are ready and if they want to. We will sincerely and with good intentions try to do our best to continue Adolph's every single vision.</p>
            <p>Official ban is implemented for all people and organizations that we and facts associate with the tragedy. They will not be  allowed to participate or anyone associated with any type of energy especially not financial. Your billions don't wort a peanut over here, you actually would be banned without taking his life for being only the weight on your local and our global community spreading negativity and violence in the sacred home(town).
