                <h4>Information:</h4>
                <p>Become one of our first investors that will change the world for the better, forever</p>
                <p>Both private customers and businesses are welcome to participate</p>
                <p>Be quick, because all investments or payments over 1000$ USD are qualified for the priority list placing. Meaning when our coin goes through The Great Redistribution phase, initial investors will have the first opportunity to sell their position for profits decreasing overall unexpected volatility</p>
                <p>Private sale for Lifecoin to receive tokens is open and investment or donation to Life Projects is open until The Great Disclosure or until reaching our funding goals</p>
                <p>Owners or shareholders are not able to profit from this funding event. Collected resources are only allowed to go towards each project as described and intended for quicker growth of our brand, organizations, and services. For rewarding the team or creators, please check the payment section on the information page</p>
                <p>Once the funding goal has been reached or 7 days since the transaction/s have passed, nobody is allowed to withdraw those funds until the profit redistribution period in order to achieve collective financial stability during the project execution stage</p>
                <p>Until funding goals are reached, everything will stay open on this site until the developer and owner fills up each and every box with personal resources from own earnings and businesses</p>
                <p>When the crowdfunding goal is reached, resources will transparently and publicly be transferred to appropriate protected bank accounts. Funds collected through our coin private sale, will still be kept on our crypto wallets or crypto exchanges</p>
                <p>Returns and benefits are available in the next version for full display. We do not want to make it sound too good to be true and repel visitors from a global natural concept. However, we would like you to know that for whichever charity or business project you invest in before The Great Disclosure 21/04/2024, your returns are minimum from our business organization for all contributions in the value of your total USD$ payment multiplied by 100, while economy guarantees multiplication by 1000. The investment amount can be from 0.00001$ USD to no limit. After the Great Redistribution, our business projects guarantee a return on investment multiplied by 10, while our economy offers minimum multiplication by 100. For example, even Jeff Bezos can get a chance today to leave Elon behind in the dust with our superior technology and sustainable innovation with only 1 billion investment. We only need a few millions to achieve all our goals within a decade without giving away ownership and thankfully improve the life of our initial supporters the most</p>
                <p>Disclaimer: To be very clear, this business model is based on collective growth, please do not invest more money than you are comfortable going towards collective growth and less fortunate. We are aiming to create the largest non-profit and for-profit organizations that will serve solely this mission while permanently improving the current state of our civilization. This is not a pump-and-dump crypto project or anything that exists now, but crypto features have been added to the full life experience concept as one of the financing options. This is a collaboration of an infinite network of interlocking complimenting projects that will serve pure utility in the real and digital world offering as many services as possible cheaper, faster, and in higher quality, quantity, and levels of sustainability than any products and categories on the market. This is all done to spark a new Golden Age of humanity where we collectively solve major problems in minimum periods requiring minimum energy instead of constantly profiting and digging each other deeper in the current outdated system. This website, with emphasis on live projects content, contains less than 0.001% of a first brick. Over the years we will show you the whole wall that we laid down already. Users knowing or not, do not want too much information at once which will impact the overall smooth experience, key information reception, and the elements of anticipative excitement levels</p>
